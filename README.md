Hi, I’m Luciano Argolo
I’m interested in Programming, Maths, physics, finance, crypto, data engineering and data analysis,
Almost everything i like makes me curious.
- I am actually studying Biomedical Engineering at 4(fourth) year.
- In the repository "LucianoArgolo22" You can find my cv, both, in English and Spanish.

# Some of my Main Projects :


### FinanceBot:
  - A Financial Bot, that works with Pyrofex, Yfinance and with Unittest for a punctual case.
  -  Repo https://github.com/LucianoArgolo22/FinanceBot/blob/main/README.md

### Customized Library Pandas-Like:A library built on native Python. that tries to replicate some behaviours.
  - Repo https://github.com/LucianoArgolo22/Customized-library-Pandas-Like-

### A backuper and Comparative lib with Python, Bash, Spark, Hive and Hadoop.
  - This library works with Python, Spark, Hive and Hadoop has a program that backups all the info of any table and any databases, inferring it's schema, and then replicates it creating a new table/tables with a new name. So info can be automatically backuped, and process can be parallelized. In the case of being parallelized, they can be compared with a comparing feature inside the lib (everything can be found inside the repo)
