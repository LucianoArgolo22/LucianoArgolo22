Hi, I’m Luciano Argolo
I’m interested in Programming, Maths, physics, finance, crypto, data engineering and data analysis,
Almost everything i like makes me curious.
- I am actually studying Biomedical Engineering at 4(fourth) year.
- In the repository "LucianoArgolo22" You can find my cv, both, in English and Spanish.


# Data Analasys and Dashboards. 

### The Proyect was generated with the intention of showing some statistics about properties in Capital Federal, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The data was gathered by a scrapper that i developed (that helped me to move to an apartment below the average price for that time)

  - Data Wrangling: For organizing the differentes segments in each column, for further analysis i have to do some wrangling
  - Data Cleansing: For cleaning and excluding outliers (not needed in this case) i used some techniques as IQR(inter quartile range), so i could work on a more realiable data, also doing some distributions, for further understanding of the data i was dealing with at each moment of the process.
  - DashBoards: Creating an interactive Power Bi dashboard with the data generated as a final product.
  - Tools Used:
    - Laguage: Python
    - Libs: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy
    - Dependencies managing: Poetry
    - Metrics and Dashboard: Power Bi
  - Repo: https://github.com/LucianoArgolo22/DataAnalysis_and_PowerBi_DashBoard


# Some of my Main Projects :

### End to End develop. Rest API connected to database (MySql) that loads batch of rows into database, generates Metrics, and with Grafana Dashboards for Metrics and data visualization:
  - Tools Used:
    - Laguage: Python
    - Framework: Flask
    - Dependencies managing: Poetry
    - Database: MySQL
    - Metrics and Dashboard: Grafana
    - Containerization and internal network connections: Docker-image and Docker-compose
  - A Rest API connected to database (MySql) that loads batch of rows into database, and generates Dashboards Metrics with Grafana. It also has endpoints that return specific metrics for further analysis. Not only Dashboards on Grafana.

### FinanceBot for arbitration (with testing in Unittest):
  - Tools Used:
    - Language: Python
    - Dependencies Managing: Poetry
    - Python Dependencies: Pyrofex, Yfinance
    - Testing Framework: Unittest   
  - A Financial Bot, that works with Pyrofex, Yfinance and with Unittest for a punctual case.

### Customized Library Pandas-Like:A library built on native Python. that tries to replicate some behaviours.
  - Tools Used:
    - Language: Python
  - A customized library pandas like, that was built absolutly and completely on native python, so it has no external dependencies (only the ones that python brings)   
  - Repo https://github.com/LucianoArgolo22/Customized-library-Pandas-Like-

### A backuper and Comparative lib with Python, Bash, Spark, Hive and Hadoop.
  - Tools Used:
    - Language: Python, Bash, Sql
    - Storage: Hadoop (parquet files)
    - Engines: Hive and Spark   
  - This library works with Python, Spark, Hive and Hadoop has a program that backups all the info of any table and any databases, inferring it's schema, and then replicates it creating a new table/tables with a new name:
    - Info can be automatically backuped, and process can be parallelized. 
    - In the case of being parallelized, they can be compared with a comparing feature inside the lib (everything can be found inside the repo)

### A video Game developed for Algorithms subject at university:
  - Tools Used:
    - Language: Wollok 
  - Video Explanation (in spanish, but you can see the game working)  
  - Repo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhnfQwR69YARepo https://github.com/LucianoArgolo22/Tony-Game-Video-Game-/blob/main/README.md
